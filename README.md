Welcome to my news repo!

In order to get things up and running, any developers will firstly need to do the following
- All Node modules must be installed
- 2 x .env files will need to be created. (.env.test and .env.development) In these you will need to add the two databases by writing the following. 
.env.test 
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test 

.env.development 
PGDATABASE=nc_news
